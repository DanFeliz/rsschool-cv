    ### About me

    I worked as a sales manager until I was 33, but website development has been my hobby always.

    Two years ago I had decided completely to become IT development.

    I know html and css very well and I am learning js very active. I have made more than 30 websites. I used HTML5,
    CSS3, a little JS and different CMS.

    I have design experience in Figma and Photoshop.

    My hobbies are cars, sport, travels, play guitar and I like video games.

    I am married, and I have two pretty daughters.

    I am looking for a job as a Junior Frontend developer. I may work fast, effective and for command interest.

    I think, If I work in company, I must do all possible for company and result.
