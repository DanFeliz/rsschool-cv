### About me

I worked as a sales manager until I was 33, but website development has been my hobby always.
Two years ago I had decided completely to become IT development.
I know html and css very well and I am learning js very active. I have made more than 30 websites. I used HTML5, CSS3, a little JS and different CMS.
I have design experience in Figma and Photoshop.
My hobbies are cars, sport ( travels, play guitar and I like video games.
I am married, and I have two pretty daughters.
I am looking for a job as a Junior Frontend developer. I may work fast, effective and for command interest.
I think, If I work in company, I must do all possible for company and result.
